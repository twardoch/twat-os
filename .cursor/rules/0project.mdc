# About twat-os

`twat-os` is a Python package providing operating system related utilities for the `twat` ecosystem. Its primary focus is on robust and configurable path management for applications and plugins.

## Key Features:
- **Path Management**: Centralized system for managing application paths (cache, config, data, logs, etc.) using `platformdirs` for cross-platform compatibility and `pydantic` for validation.
- **Configurable**: Path definitions can be customized via a `paths.toml` file.
- **Integration with `twat`**: Designed to function as a plugin within the `twat` framework.
- **Developer Experience**: Clean API with type hints.

## Development Notes
- Uses `uv` for Python package management.
- Quality tools: `ruff` for linting/formatting, `mypy` for type checking, `pytest` for testing.
- Built with Hatch and includes CI/CD setup using GitHub Actions.
- Strong typing and runtime checks are encouraged.
